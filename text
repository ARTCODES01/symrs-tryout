hello,

I hope this message finds you well. It has come to my knowledge that you are in need of a website. After carefully considering your requirements and preferences, I am excited to present our proposal for the development of a Shopify Content Management System (CMS) integrated with cutting-edge web design built in React, featuring engaging animations.

Scope of Work:

Shopify CMS Integration:
Seamless integration of a robust CMS to enhance the overall functionality and content management capabilities of your Shopify store.

React Web Design:
Crafting a modern and visually appealing web design using React, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface with animations for an optimal user experience.

Engaging Animations:
Implementation of subtle yet impactful animations to captivate your audience and create a dynamic and memorable online presence.

Three-Year Maintenance:
Comprehensive maintenance services for a duration of three years, including regular updates, security patches, and technical support to ensure your website remains at its peak performance.

Hosting Services:
Total costs (outside of hosting):

The total cost for development, design, animations, and three-year maintenance is $15,000 USD.

Initiation:
To kick off the project, a non-refundable pre-payment of $2,000 USD is required.

Maintenance Period:
Enjoy a complimentary 3-year maintenance period post-project completion. This covers minor updates and bug fixes at no extra cost. The maintenance period begins upon project completion, and you'll be notified when it starts.

Intellectual Property:
Until full payment is received, all intellectual property rights, including design, code, and documentation, remain exclusively owned by me.

External Costs:
Any external costs, such as hosting fees or third-party services essential for the project, are the client's responsibility.

Note: I also offer app development for iOS and Android at an additional cost.

Please return to me at your earliest convenience so we can initiate this project.

Best Regards,
